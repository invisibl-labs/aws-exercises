# Control Tower Setup

## What is Control Tower?

It is an AWS service that facilitates creation and management of secure multi-account AWS environment based on many security best practices standards.

If there are multiple accounts and distributed teams working on several applications, it is very difficult to setup and manage accounts and security compliances. Control Tower solves this problem.

## Benefits of Control Tower

* Easily setup and manage rules for security and compliance
* Identity management using AWS SSO directory and access management using AWS SSO
* Enables central logging and security audits across multiple accounts 
* Enables guardrails for governance and prevention of non-compliant resource deployment
* Uses AWS CloudFormation for baseline, AWS Organizations Service Control Policy to prevent config changes and AWS Config rules to detect non-compliance
* Provides visibility through the dashboard. Gives status of the resources that donâ€™t comply with the rules enabled through preventive and detective guardrails.
